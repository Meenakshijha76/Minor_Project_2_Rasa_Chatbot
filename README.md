1.	INTRODUCTION:

•	A chatbot is a software application used to conduct an online chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.
•	Chat bots typically provide a text-based user interface, allowing the user to type commands and receive text as well as text to speech response. 
•	This could be a text based (typed) conversation, a spoken conversation. Chatbot is typically perceived as engaging software entity which humans can talk to. It can be interesting, inspiring and intriguing. It appears everywhere, from old ancient HTML pages to modern advanced social networking.
Types of Chatbot:
1.	Rule Based Chatbot
Example: Eliza
2.	Self learning Chatbot /A.I Chatbot 
Example: Alexa

It is useful because of: 
•	Expensive human agents.

•	Low customer Engagement 

•	Customers don’t always know where to go to find the information they’re interested in 

•	Organizations that don’t offer 24-hour support won’t provide answers when the office is closed. 

For ex: Students need to manually visit to the college to get their queries answered by the college help desk, this process consumes a lot of time, sometimes this may lead to communication gap between college and student. 

2. MOTIVATION:
 
 How amazing it is to tell someone everything and anything and not being judged at all. A top class feeling it is and that’s what the beauty of a chatbot is. There are many people who are introvert and are unable to have a one on one conversation with other individuals, whereas some suffer from social anxiety disorder, for people like them, a Chatbot is a big save. Although all these information are already present on Internet but searching or browsing several web pages to collect information is a difficult and time consuming process. 
 
3. PROBLEM STATEMENT:

If a student is applying for admission in a university, for example let's say UPES’s site. If he/she is not having much knowledge of accessing that website, then how will the student make the best use of it?
To address this issue, we'll be creating a chatbot for assisting the user so that his/her experience while accessing the site will be smooth and the user will be able to make wise decisions for their career.

4. OBJECTIVES:

1.	To develop a self learning chatbot using Python and Rasa supported libraries.
2.	 To work as an intermediate between the new users and university, that will improve the interaction on university’s website. 
3.	 To design an efficient algorithm for chatbot to minimize the response time
4.	Comparative Analysis of developed models 



5. METHODOLOGY :

>Query will be given to the chatbot.
>The sentences will now be shortened or cleaned 
>Exploratory data analysis will take place and other techniques will also be applied
>Then the insights will be obtained and will be displayed as the output
The steps will included processes like Web scraping, Tokenization, Pre-Processing of keywords and Indexing.
